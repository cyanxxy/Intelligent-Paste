# Single Purpose Description

This extension serves a single purpose: to automatically fill web forms by intelligently analyzing clipboard content using AI.

## Primary Purpose

The extension's sole function is to assist users in filling out web forms by:

1. Capturing clipboard content (text or images)
2. Using AI to analyze and extract relevant information
3. Automatically mapping the extracted information to appropriate form fields

## Key Functionality

- When a user copies content and triggers the extension (via Alt+P or right-click)
- The extension analyzes the clipboard content using GPT-4
- It identifies relevant form fields on the current webpage
- It automatically fills those fields with the extracted information

## Why This is a Single Purpose

While the extension uses multiple technical features (clipboard access, AI processing, form field detection), they all serve the single purpose of automated form filling. Every feature directly contributes to this core functionality:

- Clipboard access: Required to get the content to be analyzed
- AI processing: Required to understand and extract information
- Form field detection: Required to identify where to place the extracted information
- DevTools panel: Required for debugging the form filling process

There are no additional features or functionalities that deviate from this single purpose of intelligent form filling.
