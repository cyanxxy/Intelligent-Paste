# Permission Justifications

## scripting Permission

The scripting permission is essential for our extension's core functionality of intelligent form filling:

1. Required to detect and analyze form fields on web pages
2. Needed to programmatically fill form fields with extracted data
3. Used to apply visual feedback when fields are successfully filled
4. Necessary for handling dynamic form interactions and validation
5. Required to highlight matched fields and their labels

Without this permission, the extension would be unable to:

- Identify form fields on the page
- Fill form fields with the extracted data
- Provide visual feedback to users
- Handle form validation events

## tabs Permission

The tabs permission is required for proper extension operation:

1. Needed to communicate between the extension's components
2. Required to identify the active tab for form filling
3. Used to ensure the extension responds to the correct tab
4. Essential for handling keyboard shortcuts in the active tab
5. Required to manage extension state per tab

Without this permission, the extension would be unable to:

- Determine which tab to fill forms in
- Handle keyboard shortcuts properly
- Maintain proper state between tabs
- Coordinate extension components

## Usage Details

Both permissions are used strictly for form filling functionality:

- No data is collected from tabs
- No scripts are injected for tracking
- All processing is done locally
- No data is shared between tabs
- Permissions are only used when explicitly triggered by user action
